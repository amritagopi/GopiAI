The GopiAI project integrates the Modular Coding Platform (MCP) with SQLite. The setup involves installing necessary NPM packages and initializing a SQLite database. The configuration is stored in `mcp.json`, detailing tools like SQLite and Serena, and servers such as sequential-thinking, ddg_search, memory, fetch, github, time, everart, and markdown2doc. SQLite integration provides database tools for initialization, query execution, data manipulation, and table creation. Serena tools offer file and code management functionalities, including language server restart, file reading, and directory listing.
