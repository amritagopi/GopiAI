GopiAI is a Python application built with PySide6 that appears to be an AI coding assistant with chat interface, terminal widget, and code execution capabilities. 

Key components:
- UI components like ChatWidget and TerminalWidget
- Agent system using MCP (Model Control Protocol)
- Code execution tools that currently have stub implementations
- Planning strategies for AI reasoning

The code appears to be mostly complete but there are some stub methods that need real implementation.
