GopiAI is a personal AI assistant designed as an alternative to subscription services, focusing on essential features without unnecessary extras. It includes support for chat agents (MCP), DuckDuckGo search, sequential thinking, file upload and processing, external function calling tools, a built-in browser (BrowserAgent), vision model support, image generation (Flux + Together.ai), and a PySide6 interface with light/dark themes. The project supports internationalization in Russian and English. It requires an LLM with vision and tools support, such as mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct or gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25, and can work with OpenRouter + MCP Tools/Vision.
